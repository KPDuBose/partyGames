#'Play a White Elephant Game
#'
#'Simulates a White Elephant party game. The gift starts at position "1" and
#'proceeds to move around the circle as each person flips a coin. If heads, the
#' present moves to the left. If tails, the present moves to the right.
#'
#'
#'To further elaborate on the rules of the game, if the player in position "1"
#'flips tails, the player to his right is sitting in position "2". If he flips
#'heads, the player to the left of position "1" is sitting in the last position.
#'
#'@name leftRightElephant

#'@param n Number of participants in the game
#'@param pheads The probability of heads, or moving the present to the left. Cannot
#'be a `NULL` value
#'
#'@return A list containing the final position of the present and a vector
#'representing the movement of the present (1 is a pass to the right, and -1
#'is a pass to the left).
#'
#'@examples
#'# 10 people playing with a fair coin
